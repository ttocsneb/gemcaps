# Hello World!

Here is a simple example of a GemCaps server.

In this example capsule, I have created some files to showcase how the filehandler works.

Below, you will find a link to a folder.

=> test/ test folder

In this folder, you will see a list of all the files in the folder! This is optional behaviour, and can be enabled with the following setting:

```yaml
handlers:
- type: file
  readDirs: true # This will enable reading of directories
```handler.yml
